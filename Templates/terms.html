            <li><strong class="has-text-weight-semibold">Agreement:</strong> By using the Site, you agree to be bound by our Terms of Use (the "TOU"). If you do not agree to the terms and conditions contained in the TOU and Finalysis’ privacy policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Site or any information contained herein. You affirm that you are over the age of 18, as the Site is not intended for children under 18.

                Change the terms and conditions of the TOU;

            <li><strong class="has-text-weight-semibold">Important Securities Disclaimer:</strong>You understand that no content published on the Site constitutes a recommendation that any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person. You understand that an investment in any security is subject to a number of risks, and that discussions of any security published on the Site will not contain a list or description of relevant risk factors. 

                You understand that data is supplied by sources believed to be reliable, that the calculations on our Site are made using such data, and that such calculations are not guaranteed by these sources, the information providers, or any other person or entity, and may not be complete.
                
                All content on the Site is presented only as of the date published or indicated, and may be superseded by subsequent market events or for other reasons. In addition, you are responsible for setting the cache settings on your browser to ensure you are receiving the most recent data.

            <li><strong class="has-text-weight-semibold">  No Investment Recommendations or Professional Advice:</strong>
                The content on the Site is being provided for information purposes only.  The Site does not provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice, and nothing on the Site should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by Finalysis or any third party. You alone are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, security or strategy, or any other product or service, is appropriate or suitable for you based on your investment objectives and personal and financial situation and for evaluating the merits and risks associated with the use of the information on the Site before making any decisions based on such information or other content.  You should consult an attorney or tax professional regarding your specific legal or tax situation. 
                
                Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Therefore, you should not assume that the future performance of any specific investment or investment strategy will be profitable or equal to corresponding past performance levels. Inherent in any investment is the potential for loss. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor. It should not be assumed that any investments in securities, companies, sectors or markets identified and described were or will be profitable. Finalysis is not a fiduciary by virtue of any person’s use of or access to the Site.  Finalysis is not a licensed securities dealer, broker or US investment adviser or investment bank.
