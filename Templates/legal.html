                    Geo-location data; 
                    
                    Audio, Video and other Electronic Data
                    
                    Professional or employment-related information; and
                    
                    Profiles and Inferences.
                    
                    Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), "sale" is defined very broadly and includes a wide array of data sharing. As the term is defined by the CCPA, we “sold” the following categories of personal information in the last 12 months: identifiers/contact information, Internet or other electronic network activity information, and inferences drawn from the above. We “sold” such information to advertising networks, data analytics providers, and social networks. The business or commercial purposes of “selling” personal information is for third-party companies to perform services on our behalf, such as marketing, advertising, and audience measurement. We do not have any actual knowledge that we "sell" personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.
                    
                    Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal.
                    
                    California Privacy Rights
                    
                    If you are a California resident, you have the following consumer privacy rights:
                    
                    Right to Know: You have the right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold over the past 12 months, and information about our data practices.      
                    
                    Right to request deletion: You can request that we delete personal information about you.  Although you may request deletion, we are allowed, under California law, to keep certain personal information. You can submit a request to delete by submitting a form here.    
                    
                    Right to Opt-Out of "Sale" of personal information: You can opt out of the "sale" of your personal information to "third parties" by clicking on this link (as those terms are defined in the CCPA).       
                    
                    Right to be Notified of Financial Incentives: You have the right to be notified of any financial incentives offers and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any time, and may not be included in such incentives without your prior informed opt-in consent. We do not offer any such incentives at this time. 
                    
                    Right to Non-Discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. 
                    
                     
                    
                    California law also permits you to request certain information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us and our related companies to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
                    
                    In addition to the specific forms listed above, you can exercise any of these rights by contacting us at privacy@finalysis.co and providing us with your name, email address and address (including zip code) or by submitting a request to us through your Finalysis account.  We may verify your identity by asking you to submit a request through your password protected Finalysis account and by providing us with your California zip code or other proof of California residency. 
                    
                    You can also authorize an agent to submit a request on your behalf.  An authorized agent must have your signed permission to submit a request on your behalf or provide proof that they have power of attorney in accordance with California probate law. Authorized agents that are business entities must be registered with the California Secretary of State to conduct business in California. Where you use an agent, we will ask for verification of your authorization, namely a copy of your written authorization for the agent to submit the request on your behalf.   
                    
                    We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.  We do not discriminate against any consumer for exercising their consumer rights.
                    
    
                    Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

                    Legal Basis
                    
                    Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information is usually as follows:
                    
                    Performance of a contract: where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, for example setting up and administering your account and providing our products and services
                    
                    Legal obligation: where we have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, for example to comply with financial, accounting and other legal obligations
                    
                    Legitimate interests: where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, for example to analyze and improve how our products and services are used, and to provide you with customer service
                    
                    Consent: where we have your consent to do so, for example in relation to certain types of marketing  
                    
                    International Data Transfers
                    
                    Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. Specifically, our Site servers are located in the United States, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries.
                    
                    Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Finalysis has taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
                    
                    When we transfer your personal information to any other territories, we will take such measures as are appropriate to safeguard your information in accordance with applicable law. For EEA and UK residents' personal information, this may include implementing the Standard Contractual Clauses for any such international transfers.
                    
                    Data retention
                    
                    We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).  
                    
                    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
